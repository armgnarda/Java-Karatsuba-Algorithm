# Java-Karatsuba-Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm in Java. Karatsuba algorithm is a fast multiplication algorithm that utilizes divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently multiply large integers. The code demonstrates how to implement the Karatsuba algorithm recursively to multiply two large numbers.
